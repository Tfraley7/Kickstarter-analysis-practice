Based on the Kickstarter Campaign data provided by Louise. There were several findings within the data that could assist Louise with future decision making to make campaigns successful. Theater plays met and/or exceeded more goals than other theatrical acts. Theater musicals had 40 failed events, and 45 successful events. Theater spaces had 59 failures, and 68 successful events. However, theater plays greatly outperformed the spaces and musicals. Theater plays had 250 failures, but made up for it with 412 successful plays. To outline the revenue gained from plays it could be helpful to analyze the revenue gained from plays in the United States. In the United States the successful theater plays brought in $2,307,836.87 of revenue.In addition to the success of the US play campaigns. It should be mentioned that the GB data contained in the "Box Plot" sheet outlines musicals in Great Britain. The data provided shows hte mean campaign goal around £4,000 which is not within range of the outliers. This could be a good sign that Louise should produce her campaigns for less than £4,000, because 50%of the campaign goals were less than £2,000. When observing quartiles and their relationship with the campaigns. The campaign goals that were less than £2,000 were higher than what was pledged for the 3rd quartile.
